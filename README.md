# yawp
A command line (CLI) app for publishing social media posts.

## In brief

`yawp` takes some text as an argument and publishes it to the social media accounts of your choice. Current options are Twitter and Mastodon, it's possible more will be added in future (or not).

`yawp` is specifically designed to fit within a broader toolchain: in general terms it tries to follow "the Unix philosophy":

* can take input from `stdin` (e.g. redirected from a file or another process)
* outputs the message as plaintext to `stdout` (i.e. the output is the input)
* takes all configuration from environment (`ENV`) values to enable flexibility

## Usage:
`yawp [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <YAWP>`

## Flags:
`-h`, `--help` Prints help information  
`-m`, `--mastodon` Send toot  
`-q`, `--quiet` Suppress output (error messages will still be sent to `stderr`)  
`-t`, `--twitter` Send tweet  
`-V`, `--version` Prints version information  

## Options:
`-e`, `--env <env>` path to env file  

## Args:
`<YAWP>` Message (post) to send.

If using `stdin` you must provide a hyphen (`-`) as the argument. However if you do this and are *not* redirecting `stdin` from somewhere, `yawp` will hang your shell unless you supply `EOF` by pressing `Ctrl + D`. (See **example 5** below).

## Environment variables

`yawp` requires some environment variables in order to actually publish your message. You can set these in a number of ways depending on your operating system. `yawp` also allows you to call them in from a file. See **example 6** for using a file or **example 7** for setting environment values at the same time you call `yawp`.

An example environment variables file is provided at `example.env`.

The possible values are:

### Mastodon

For Mastodon you need the base url of your instance (server), and an API access token.

* `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` - You can create a token at `settings - applications` in your Mastodon account. You require `write:statuses` permission.
* `MASTODON_BASE_URL` - This is the base URL of your server. e.g. `https://mastodon.social`

### Twitter

For Twitter you need the four tokens provided when you create an app at `https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps`.

* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`
* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`
* `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
* `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET`

## Examples

1. Provide message on command line:

```bash
yawp 'Hello, World!' -t
# Output: Hello, World!
# Tweets: Hello, World!
```

2. Pipe in message:

```bash
echo 'Hello again, World!' | yawp - -m

# Output: Hello again, World!
# Toots: Hello again, World!
```

3. Read from file

```bash
# create a file
(echo Hello fronds; echo "     It's me"; echo ...a tree ðŸŒ³) > message.txt

# run yawp and direct file content into it
yawp - <message.txt

# this does the same thing:
cat message.txt | yawp -

# Output: 
#Hello fronds
#     It's me
#...a tree ðŸŒ³

```
4. Chain commands

You can redirect the output of `yawp` as well as the input:

```bash
cat message.txt | yawp - > output.txt

# the message.txt and output.txt files are now identical.
```

5. Read from user input

This is not really recommended, but you may find yourself facing a user input prompt if you use a hyphen without providing any redirected input. i.e. if you do this:

```bash
yawp - 
# machine awaits user further input from command line
```
Don't panic, you can provide the message text by typing it in at the command prompt. There is a catch, however, in that `yawp` will wait for further input until it reaches `EOF` (End of File). This will not happen when you press `Enter` but can usually be provided by pressing `Ctrl + D`:

```bash
yawp -t - 
# machine awaits user further input from command line
Awoo!
[Ctrl + D]
# Output: Awoo!
# Tweets: Awoo!
```

6. Provide environment variables from file

In some situtations (e.g. [when using Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)) you may have already set environment variables specific to those needed by `yawp`. If not, you can call them in from a file by providing the filepath using `-e` or `--env`:

```bash
yawp -m --env 'yawp.env' 'I love to toot!'
```

7. Provide environment variables on command line

You could also set `ENV` settings manually when you call `yawp`:

```bash
MASTODON_BASE_URL=https://ausglam.space MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=abcd1234 yawp -m 'ðŸŽº I am tooting!'
```
